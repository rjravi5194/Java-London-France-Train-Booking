**Assessment Requirements:**

Code must be published in Github with a link we can access (use public repo).

Code must compile with some effort on unit tests, doesn't have to be 100%, but it shouldn't be 0%.

Please code this using Java.

Adding a persistence layer will be cumbersome, so just store the data in your current session/in memory.

The higher the level you are applying for (e.g. Staff or Principal), the more we will expect things like using an in-memory database and JPQL in this assignment.

If a requirement is ambiguous or unclear, use your best judgment to interpret it and make what you believe are reasonable assumptions.

When the assignment is ready, send the console output from your app-server and app-client.

You can also include your reasonable assumptions and known limitations.


**App to be coded:**

I want to board a train from London to France. The train ticket will cost $5.

Create an API where you can submit a purchase for a ticket. Details included in the receipt are:
a) From, To, User , price paid.
(i) User should include first and last name, email address
The user is allocated a seat in the train. Assume the train has only 2 sections, section A and section B.

An API that shows the details of the receipt for the user.

An API that lets you view the users and seat they are allocated by the requested section.

An API to remove a user from the train.

An API to modify a user's seat.

**Assumptions and Note:**

We have used h2 in-memory database for the assessment.

The h2 Console DB screenshots are also attached in the folder.

The Swagger is enabled and the screenshots are attached in the folder.

The Sonar Coverage is covered to a fex extent and the SOnarlint coverage screenshot is added.
